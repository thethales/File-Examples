description: A torrent file or meta-info file is a computer file that contains metadata
  about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network
  locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system
  find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.[1] A torrent
  file does not contain the content to be distributed; it only contains information
  about those files, such as their names, folder structure, and sizes obtained via
  cryptographic hash values for verifying file integrity. The term torrent may refer
  either to the metadata file or to the files downloaded, depending on the context.
