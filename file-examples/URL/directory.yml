description: A URL file is a shortcut file referenced by web browsers. It contains
  a web URL and may also store a reference to the favicon.ico icon file, which is
  displayed as the icon for the shortcut file. Creting an ```.url``` file on Windows
  is quite simple, simply drag the URL address from your browser window onto your
  desktop. ( On a Mac, that action will create a ```webloc```file).
