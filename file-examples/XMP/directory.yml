description: "```.xmp``` the so-called _sidecars files_, are ```.xml``` files used\
  \ by [DarkTable](https://www.darktable.org/) a non-destructive image editor, to\
  \ store information about the images as well as the full editing history without\
  \ touching the original raw files. For a given source image, multiple editing versions,\
  \ called duplicates, can co-exist, sharing the same input (raw) data but each having\
  \ their own metadata, tags and history stack. Each duplicate is represented by a\
  \ separate XMP sidecar file with a filename constructed in the form _<basename>_nn.<extension>.xmp_,\
  \ where nn represents the (minimum two-digit) version number of that edit. Information\
  \ for the initial edit \xE2\u20AC\u201C the _duplicate_ with version number zero\
  \ \xE2\u20AC\u201C is stored in the sidecar file _<basename>.<extension>.xmp_."
