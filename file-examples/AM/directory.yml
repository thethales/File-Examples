description: '```Makefile.am``` is a programmer-defined file and is used by ```automake```
  to generate the Makefile.in file (the .am stands for automake). ```GNU Automake```
  is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files compliant with the GNU
  Coding Standards ([See more](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)). This software
  is part of [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html) wich
  is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically
  configure software source code packages. These scripts can adapt the packages to
  many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf creates
  a configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the operating
  system features that the package can use, in the form of M4 macro calls.'
