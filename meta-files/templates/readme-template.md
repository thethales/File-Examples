# Index of File Examples

This repository can be defined as:
- A collection of file examples of different formats.
- Samples of files and structures for everyday use.
- A compendium of links of sample files throughout the internet.

The general ideia, is to provide an index of materials for those situations in software development or design where you might need to do some unit testing with real world files.

Below the files are listed by _category_ and _type/context_.
