## FBX

```.fbx``` (Filmbox) is a proprietary file format owned by Autodesk since 2006. It is currently one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools[¹](https://code.blender.org/2013/08/fbx-binary-file-format-specification/) [²](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX). FBX has a text based (ascii) and a binary version. There's no known public documentation avaliable, notes on the innerworkings of the format are provided in the following links:
